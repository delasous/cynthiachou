                Tangerine Telecom is a relatively new Australian broadband provider known for their exceptional service and bright orange mascot, Peely. 
                As their customer base was quickly surpassing 10,000, they approached Comm100 for a chatbot solution that would help scale their customer support operations and handle the most basic FAQs to start.

                As Comm100â€™s first chatbot specialist, I brought my experience and knowledge of conversational UX to onboard and guide the Tangerine team through the bot creation process. 
                This spanned from the design of the botâ€™s onboarding experience and info architecture of the botâ€™s responses, to the voice and tone of the bot in different user contexts.

                Peely received an average in-chat rating of 4.2/5 star within the first 3 months of his launch, with many positive comments about his relatable Australian persona and the conversational nature of his responses.

                        We gathered call logs from Tangerine's Customer Care team to answer the following questions:

                        <li>
                            What types of topcis are users really querying for?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How do users format their questions in a typical conversation?

                        <li>
                            What follow-up questions or requests do users pose after their initial intent is resolved?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How do call center agents responde to each type of question, both in content and in tone?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p className='px-6 pb-3'>
                        Tangerine's website FAQs page also served as a secondary source of data for the types and frequency of user questions
                        that we could expect the bot to receive.

                            Tangerine provided an initial draft of bot responses from a business and technical perspective; I then edited them for
                            clarity, brevity, consistency of voice, tone, and connecting responses into a conversational flow with quick-reply buttons.
